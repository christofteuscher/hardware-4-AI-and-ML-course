Hardware for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
ECE 410/510
Spring 2025

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Hardware (HW) is the foundation upon which artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems
are built. It provides the necessary computational power, efficiency, and flexibility to drive innovation in
these emerging fields. By using HW/SW co-design, students will learn how to use, design, simulate,
optimize, and evaluate specialized HW, such as GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, and neuromorphic chips, for modern
AI/ML algorithms. The intersection of HW and AI/ML is a rapidly growing field with significant career
opportunities for computer engineers.
