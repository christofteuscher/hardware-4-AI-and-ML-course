HARDWARE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING
ECE 410/510
Spring 2025

The course was proposed and developed by Christof Teuscher. It was first offered for both undergraduate 
and graduate students during the spring term of 2025 in the Department of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering (ECE) at Portland State University (PSU).  

This Github repository contains all relevant course materials for the Spring 2025 course offering.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Hardware (HW) is the foundation upon which artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems
are built. It provides the necessary computational power, efficiency, and flexibility to drive innovation 
in these emerging fields. By using HW/SW co-design, students will learn how to use, design, simulate,
optimize, and evaluate specialized HW, such as GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, and neuromorphic chips, for modern
AI/ML algorithms. The central emphasis on SW/HW is a critical approach for optimizing artificial intelligence 
algorithms using specialized hardware. This methodology involves a holistic view of system design, where 
tasks are strategically partitioned between software and hardware components to achieve maximum efficiency 
and performance. The intersection of HW and AI/ML is a rapidly growing field with significant career
opportunities for computer engineers. 

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- Understand the principles and tools for SW/HW co-design.
- Understand the foundations of neural networks.
- Understand the foundations of Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Understand the foundations of specialized hardware for AI/ML, such as GPUs, TPU, FPGAs, and neuromorphic architectures.
- Capable of mapping algorithms onto hardware.
- Capable of evaluating HW designs.
- Capable of optimizing HW designs through co-design for computational power, efficiency, and flexibility.
- Capable of using modern SW and HW tools for designing and using specialized HW for AI/ML.
