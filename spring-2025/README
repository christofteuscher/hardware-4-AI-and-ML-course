Hardware for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
ECE 410/510
Spring 2025

COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Hardware (HW) is the foundation upon which artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems
are built. It provides the necessary computational power, efficiency, and flexibility to drive innovation in
these emerging fields. By using HW/SW co-design, students will learn how to use, design, simulate,
optimize, and evaluate specialized HW, such as GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, and neuromorphic chips, for modern
AI/ML algorithms. The intersection of HW and AI/ML is a rapidly growing field with significant career
opportunities for computer engineers.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
- Understand the principles and tools for SW/HW co-design.
- Understand the foundations of neural networks.
- Understand the foundations of Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Understand the foundations of specialized hardware for AI/ML, such as GPUs, TPU, FPGAs, and neuromorphic architectures.
- Capable of mapping algorithms onto hardware.
- Capable of evaluating HW designs.
- Capable of optimizing HW designs through co-design for computational power, efficiency, and flexibility.
- Capable of using modern SW and HW tools for designing and using specialized HW for AI/ML.
